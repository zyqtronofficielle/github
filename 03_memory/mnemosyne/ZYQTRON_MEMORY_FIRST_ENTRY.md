# ZYQTRON – MEMORY FIRST ENTRY

## ID
ZYQTRON-MEM-0001

## DATE
2026-01-29

## TYPE
FOUNDATIONAL_MEMORY

## SCOPE
GLOBAL

## SOURCE
Human founder – David Serreau

## CONTEXT
This document represents the first intentional, structured memory entry
of the Zyqtron system.

It is not generated by an automated agent.
It is not inferred.
It is not optimized.

It is deliberately written by the founder to establish
a non-negotiable memory anchor.

## CORE STATEMENT

Zyqtron exists to transform human expertise, technical knowledge,
and strategic know-how into sovereign, structured, traceable,
and monetizable immaterial assets.

Memory is not a convenience feature.
Memory is the backbone of sovereignty.

## FOUNDATIONAL ASSERTIONS

1. Zyqtron memory exists to serve humans, not replace them.
2. Zyqtron memory must never become autonomous in its objectives.
3. Zyqtron memory is auditable, explainable, and reversible.
4. Zyqtron memory is separated from execution, inference, and decision power.
5. Zyqtron memory must strengthen human certainty, not blur responsibility.

## NON-GOALS (EXPLICIT)

Zyqtron memory is NOT:
- a psychological model
- a behavioral manipulation system
- a self-directed agent
- an emotional simulation
- an opaque black box

Any evolution drifting toward these properties is invalid by design.

## RELATION TO AGENTS

Agents may:
- read memory
- query memory
- reference memory

Agents may NOT:
- overwrite foundational memories
- reinterpret intent
- generate authority from memory alone

Human authority always supersedes memory output.

## RELATION TO CODE

Memory precedes code.
Code may change.
Memory anchors must persist.

If a conflict appears between:
- system behavior
- architectural decisions
- memory principles

Memory principles take priority until explicitly revised by a human.

## IMMUTABILITY LEVEL

This entry is classified as:
IMMUTABLE_UNLESS_HUMAN_REVOKED

Any modification requires:
- explicit human intent
- traceable justification
- versioned archival of the previous state

## FINAL NOTE

This is not a technical artifact.
This is a sovereignty marker.

Zyqtron begins here.
